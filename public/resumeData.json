        "bio": "I love challenges. Moving to Canada was the riskiest but also the best decision I have ever made. I love travelling and practicing sports. Having started (but not finished) a CS Degree in Brazil, I decided to leave the finance world and finally begin my career in the tech industry. Taking a Software Development Bootcamp was a great way to get back on track and freshen up my programming skills. Now I work as a Full Stack Developer and help bootcamp students reach their goals.",
